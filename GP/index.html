           A schoolboy will make his mark in history today when he becomes the youngest person ever to present a petition before the Scottish Parliament.

Seven-year-old Callum Isted will hand over his case to politicians this afternoon for every primary school pupil in Scotland to receive a reusable water bottle.;<p>The youngster's campaign follows his own success after he raised cash to buy refillable bottles for his fellow schoolmates at Dedridge Primary School in Livingston.

Keen to make a difference, he also said he wants to take action to fix broken taps in schools "so that we can use the bottles properly”.</p></div>

            On Sunday night a reported robbery happened within the Starbucks located at Designer Outlet. Luckily no one was harmed during the robbery, the police are currently in the process of questioning each employee who were working that day and they are urging anyone who was near the Starbucks on Sunday night to come forward with anything to help build on the case. Key witnesses have already said that they spotted some suspicious looking people in the shop that night and some employees have said a particular employee has a chip on his shoulder.</p>

            <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>

            <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>

            <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. <span class="citation">"Don't under&shy;estimate the Force. I suggest you try it again, Luke."</span> This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
            <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p></div>
